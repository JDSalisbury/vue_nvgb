Flotilla is a three-dimensional turn based strategy space combat game, in other words, it's dope. 

This gem dropped in 2010, but it still holds strong with it's rogue-light feel and game play that plays out a lot like "Super Hot." You find your self flying from star system to star system encountering talking space animals, running into derelict ships, freakin space pirates, and all other sorts of quirky nonsense along the way.

## Gameplay Overview
You start with two small ships, and after each battle you get a mod to upgrade your ships with. If a ship is destroyed in battle, it's lost forever along with all the mods attached to it, but don't fear! You can find other ships along the way to grow your flotilla back to full power.



## Combat
Where the game truly shines is with it's simple yet complex combat. You and the enemy ships start in a 3D space, and can fly and orient your ships in any kind of direction you see fit. The Goal being to out manuever your opponent and destroy their ships. 

The secret to success, the ships have armor, and is primarily positioned on the front of the ship. Spinning and rotating your ships in such a way to maximize the incoming missile to hit your armor while attempting to score them bottom hit's for maximum damage, becomes sort of a beautiful, but deadly, dance. Space dance.

The turn based aspect of it all plays nice as well, you plot the height depth and direction you wish your ship to travel in, and select the target you wish to aim at and the orientation you want your ship in. Then you press play. And watch it all go down.

## Final Thoughts

This is a fun, and relaxing game with great turn based combat, and it's only $10 on steam. The music is kind of monotonous after a while, but it's nice and mellow, very classy,  and makes me feel as if I should be drinking some scotch and smoking a cigar as I command my ships about the battlefield.
